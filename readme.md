### How to Set Up a Node.js Project on GitHub

1. **Open an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: Open any IDE like Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
   
2. **Drag and Drop Your Project Folder**: Drag and drop the folder you want to create your project into the IDE.
   
3. **Initialize NPM**: Open the integrated terminal and type `npm init` to initialize a new Node.js project. Follow the prompts to set up your project's package.json file.
   
4. **Create a README File**: Create a `README.md` file in your project directory and add any content you'd like. For example, you can simply type "Hey" or "Hi".
   
5. **Connect to GitHub**:
   - **a)** Initialize Git: Run `git init` in the terminal to initialize a new Git repository.
   - **b)** Stage Changes: Run `git add .` to stage all changes for commit.
   - **c)** Commit Changes: Run `git commit -m "Initial commit"` to commit the changes with a descriptive message.

6. **Create a Repository on GitHub**:
   - Go to GitHub and create a new repository.
   - Copy the last two commands provided on the repository creation page.
   - Paste these commands into your terminal to connect your local repository to the remote GitHub repository.

7. **Set Up Project Structure**:
   - Create a `public` folder to store public files like images, stylesheets, etc.
   - Inside the `public` folder, create a `temp` folder to store temporary data on the server.
   - Add a `.gitkeep` file inside the `public` folder to keep track of it in Git.

8. **Create a `.gitignore` File**:
   - Create a `.gitignore` file in your project directory to specify files and directories that Git should ignore.
   - You can generate a `.gitignore` file tailored for Node.js projects using websites like gitignore.io.

9. **Create Source Directory (src)**:
   - Create a `src` directory to store your source code files.
   - Inside the `src` directory, create required files like `app.js`, `constants.js`, etc.

10. **Install Nodemon and Dotenv**:
    - Run `npm install nodemon dotenv --save-dev` to install Nodemon and Dotenv as development dependencies.

Now, your Node.js project is set up on GitHub with a basic structure, ready for development.
